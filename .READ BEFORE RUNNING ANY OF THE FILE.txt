**REQUIRES UPDATION**

Hello there from the Developer!

OPEN THIS TEXT DOCUMENT IN FULLSCREEN SO THAT ENTIRE TEXT IS VISIBLE!

Requirements:
1. Python 3.7.X
2. MySQL (Preferably Latest Version)
3. pip should be installed

First of all, you need to install a particular Python-MySQL connector module.
Any other version of this particular Python-MySQL connector won't do the work!
Run the cmd in the Pyhton37 folder as admin.
execute the following command:
pip install mysql-connector-python

Now, you need to install the second module: Pillow.
Run the cmd in the Pyhton37 folder as admin.
execute the following command:
pip install pillow

Before operating the LOGNOTE application, you need to do little bit of editing in these files:
1. for_admin.py
2. for_students.py
3. LOGNOTE.py
4. run_for_first_time_only_once.py
in IDLE.

Now, open the abovementioned python files in 'Edit with IDLE mode' and open in fullscreen so that the entire code is visible.
Once opened, you will find '######CHANGE HERE###########' written besides certain lines in the code.
Those codes are there to establish connection with your MySQL Server.
You need to change only 3 variables here:
1. user
2. passwd
3. host
You can find the information about your username, password and host name in MySQL command line.
DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING EXTRA!!!

After doing the necessary changes, run the 'run_for_first_time_only_once.py' file.
Open this file with IDLE to see what it does.

Finally, you're all set to use the application LOGNOTE!
Open the Python file named LOGNOTE.
enter username: admin
enter password: admin
Perform the necessary operaions.

WARNING: DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING EXTRA IN THE CODE AS IT MIGHT CAUSE ERRORS AND EVENTUALLY THE PROGRAM WON'T RUN!!!

Have Fun!
